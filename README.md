# Number Game
This project is made in my first year at university. It is one of the first Python projects i have made. The purpose of this project is to build a Python project using the Python dictionaries. I used Flask dictionary in this one and built a number guessing game.
How this game works is the program chooses a number and you try to guess the number by putting inputs. After you put inputs the program tells you if the number is lower or higher and at the end it tells you how many guesses it needed to guess the number.
